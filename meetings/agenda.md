## Items to discuss

- Should we have a list of "companies using Laminas" for the website?
  On the ZF website, we had a section of the homepage that shared logos of
  companies using the framework. This helped establish the breadth of adoption,
  which helped promote the ecosystem.

  Should we do this for Laminas? Matthew has asked the LF legal representative,
  and he has indicated:

  > [The] requirement [...] is that you have permission for us to list their
  > logo. Generally an email request that we display a logo and storing that email
  > will be enough

  Are we interested in doing this?
