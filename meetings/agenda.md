## Items to discuss

- List organizations offering support?
  Matthew has had a few companies and contractors ask about having their
  information listed on the site as providing commercial support, and a few
  others asking about what commercial support offerings exist.

  He asked the LF legal representative about if this is allowed, and, if so,
  what stipulations there might be around it. His response:

  > [Y]ou can either have a formal program with criteria or an informal program.
  > If it's a formal program, you list people that qualify. If it's informal, you
  > list people that ask.  If you find that people are just asking to get the logo
  > listed without really supporting, I would recommend a charter for a support
  > program that would list minimum criteria.

  The argument for listing support providers is that it helps establish that
  there's a healthy ecosystem.

  Do we want to list support providers? If so, do we want to do so informally
  (list anyone who asks) or formally (establish criteria)?
