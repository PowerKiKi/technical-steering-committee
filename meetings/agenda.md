## Items to discuss

- GreetBot
  Last month, when discussing how to reduce noise in Slack, we discussed ways we
  can direct Slack users towards appropriate engagement â€” e.g., pushing them to
  use the forums to ask questions, reminding them of the TSC meetings, etc.
  Aleksei (@Xerkus) pointed me towards [GreetBot](https://greet.bot) as a
  possible solution.

  Their free plan only provides one message on signup, and a message for joining
  a channel (exactly ONE channel). Their "Plus" plan is $12/month, and offers up
  to 15 messages per user (e.g., a signup message, a reminder a week in, etc.),
  as well as messages per-channel (e.g., to tell them what the purpose of a
  channel is, where to go on the forums for more help, where the docs are,
  etc.). I reached out to see if they have OSS discounts, and they do: half-off.

  I'm willing to pay for this out of my GitHub sponsors funds; do we want to do
  this?
