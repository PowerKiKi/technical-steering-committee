# Technical Steering Committee Voting Process

While the Project aims to operate as a consensus-based community, many decisions
will require a vote in order to move forward: approval of new repositories
or subprojects, approval of archival/abandonment of repositories or subprojects,
approval of new maintainers, selection of Project Lead, etc.

Voting will happen either within a meeting, or via electronic vote.

For purposes of this document, when 50% results in a fraction, `ceil(50%)` is
implied.

## TSC Meeting Votes

Meetings will happen on the first Monday of each month. An agenda will be
provided in the repository, with the ability for anybody to request an item be
added, modified, or removed via pull request.

Per the charter, quorum for a meeting requires at least 50% of all TSC members
present. If quorum is not met, the meeting may continue, but no votes or
decisions may be made.

A vote may be called during a meeting. Such votes pass only if a simple majority
of those present in the meeting approve. If a vote passes, but does not
receive 50% of all TSC members (not just those present) approving, we will hold
an asynchronous electronic vote to validate the decision.

## Asynchronous Electronic Votes

A vote may be initiated outside meetings, using technologies such as Google
Forms or [ADoodle](https://adoodle.org); anonymous votes are encouraged, but
all voting results must be published publicly on completion (per the charter).
In such cases, per the charter, a decision is only binding if at least 50% of
all TSC members approve.

The voting period for asynchronous votes is 2 weeks, or until all TSC members
have voted, whichever comes first.

## Decisions requiring a vote

The following list is non-exhaustive.

- Approval of new Maintainers (only requires a simple majority approval).

- Approval of a new TSC member.

- Selection of Project Lead.

- Acceptance of a new repository to the Project or a subproject.
